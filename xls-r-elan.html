        This is a local recognizer that offers automatic speech recognition
        functions using a fine-tuned model based on
        <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-300m">Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300M</a>,
        a large-scale, multilingual pretrained model for speech developed by
        Facebook AI.  This recognizer allows the user to select an audio
        recording and a tier from this transcript as input, then passes both
        the sound and annotations on to a fine-tuned XLS-R model for
        processing, producing a new tier containing the model's output.
